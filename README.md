FAQ Chatbot
Overview
The FAQ Chatbot is a simple command-line chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions based on pre-defined queries. It uses natural language processing techniques to match user input with the closest FAQ.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
nltk library for natural language processing
scikit-learn library for machine learning
Installation
If you don't have the required libraries, you can install them using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk scikit-learn
Additionally, ensure you download the necessary NLTK resources:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage
To run the FAQ Chatbot, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python faq_chatbot.py
Simply type your question and the chatbot will respond with the most relevant answer. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

Language Translation Tool
Overview
The Language Translation Tool is a command-line application that allows you to translate text from one language to another using Google Translate.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
googletrans library for translation
Installation
If you don't have the required libraries, you can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
Usage
To run the Language Translation Tool, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python language_translator.py
Follow the prompts to enter the text you wish to translate, the source language, and the target language. The tool will output the translated text.

Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking
Overview
This project is a real-time object detection and tracking system using the YOLOv5 deep learning model. The system uses a webcam feed to detect and track objects in real-time.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
opencv-python for video processing
torch and torchvision for deep learning
yolov5 model from Ultralytics
Installation
If you don't have the required libraries, you can install them using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python torch torchvision
Additionally, load the YOLOv5 model directly using PyTorch Hub:

python
Copy code
import torch
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')
Usage
To run the Object Detection and Tracking system, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python object_detection_tracking.py
This will start your webcam and display the video feed with real-time object detection and tracking. Press 'q' to exit the application.
